Zehnder Q350 ventilation unit MQTT to Domoticz

This is a mod for the python library that michael arnauts has written on https://github.com/michaelarnauts/comfoconnect/ so that it would work together with any MQTT enabled smart home software (openhab in my case).

Information using MQTT and Node-Red is push to Domoticz, at moment also from Domoticz can control Zehnder speeds.
